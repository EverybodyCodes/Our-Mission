# Our Mission(s)


## 1) Create A World Where Everybody Codes

Not everyone has to work professionally as a software engineer, but we believe the undergoing the experience of coding can and should have a positive effect on every person that exercises and enhances critical thinking skills.

As the great Steve Jobs once said, "Everyone should learn how to program a computer... because it teaches you how to think".


## 2) Reject No One
We say that Everybody Codes is about teaching everybody to code, and we mean _everybody!_ We do not discriminate against any people on the basis of _anything,_ and we believe that there is no person who lacks the potential to learn to code.


## 3) Help The Disadvantaged
Although we're fully supportive of hardworking white males who become great coders, the sad reality is that the status quo and recent history of the world make it easier for some people to succeed than others. We want to rebalance things, create a fair and welcoming atmosphere for everyone, and provide the largest amount of positive impact we can. In an attempt to do things we love looking out for the most disadvantaged groups to teach the joy of coding!
